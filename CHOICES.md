# This is to show the choices we ended up using for our project

# So why OVH?
* OVH provides solid performance for paying at such a low price making this making this the most easiest at being reliable and even beginner friendly for our project and easily fits a student budget.
* choosing OVH was a solid decision because it was perfect for our project instead of using something more complex and possibly more expensive for project.

# Why NGINX?
* NGINX is normally built for speed and efficiency, it's able to handle high traffic regardless if you have low CPU/Memory usage.
* Other options such as Apache were more heavier and wasn't something we were aiming for.

# Why Container
