# This is to show the choices we ended up using for our project

# So why OVH?
* OVH provides solid performance for paying at such a low price making this making this the most easiest at being reliable and even beginner friendly for our project and easily fits a student budget.
* choosing OVH was a solid decision because it was perfect for our project instead of using something more complex and possibly more expensive for project.

# Why NGINX?
* NGINX is normally built for speed and efficiency, it's able to handle high traffic regardless if you have low CPU/Memory usage.
* Other options such as Apache were more heavier and wasn't something we were aiming for.

# Why Containers
* We used containers because:
  * They are lightweight
  * runs the same on any system
  * portable
* We did think about VMs but we saw that they used more resources and also take longer to manage

# Why GitHub actions
* GitHub Actions is a feature that automates deployment the second you push a block of code in which removes all the manual work to keep updates fast and consistent
* Manual deployment was possible but it doesnt compare to having things updated faster
