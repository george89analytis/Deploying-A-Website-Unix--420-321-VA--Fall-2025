# A Deep Analysis of our project
So the goal for this project is to essentially set up a Linux based web server hosted by OVH to deploy a simple website. This is done by installing and configuring NGNIX to running that inside a container and then connecting the server to a github repository so that any new/recently made changes are automatically pushed to GitHub and updates the website in an instant all by using Github actions. By doing this, this setup allows us to manage our website without having to manually update all the time.

# A short summary of our project
* we start by hosting a website on a OVH Debian server
* Run NGINX inside a container
* provide website code using a Github repository
* Using GitHub actions to automatically update our website

# What's Required???
* an OVH Debian server
* NGINX successfully running in a container
* a GitHub repository containing website code
* configuring GitHub actions for automatic deployment

# What does our GitHub repository contain?:
So our GitHub repository includes the following files:
* CHOICES.md ---> this showcases the tools we used for this project and also includes reasoning to why we use it.
* INSTALL.md ---> this file includes the the instructions needed/required to use our project
