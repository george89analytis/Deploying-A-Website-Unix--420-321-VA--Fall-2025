# Deploying-A-Website-Unix--420-321-VA--Fall-2025
So the goal for this project is to essentially set up a Linux based web server hosted by OVH to deploy a simple website. This is done by installing and configuring NGNIX to running that inside a container and then connecting the server to a github repository so that any new/recently made changes are automatically pushed to GitHub and updates the website in an instant all by using Github actions. By doing this, this setup allows us to manage our website without having to manually update all the time.
