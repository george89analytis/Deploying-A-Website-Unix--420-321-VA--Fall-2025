# A Deep Analysis of our project
So the goal for this project is to essentially set up a Linux based web server hosted by OVH to deploy a simple website. This is done by installing and configuring NGNIX to running that inside a container and then connecting the server to a github repository so that any new/recently made changes are automatically pushed to GitHub and updates the website in an instant all by using Github actions. By doing this, this setup allows us to manage our website without having to manually update all the time.

# A short summary of our project
* we start by hosting a website on a OVH Debian server
* Run NGINX inside a container
* provide website code using a Github repository
* Using GitHub actions to automatically update our website

# What's Required???
* an OVH Debian server
* NGINX successfully running in a container
* a GitHub repository containing website code
* configuring GitHub actions for automatic deployment

# What does our GitHub repository contain?:
So our GitHub repository includes the following files:
* CHOICES.md ---> this file discusses the tools used such as:
  * The use of OVH
  * The use of NGINX
  * Containers
  * GitHub Actions
* For more Information, please visit CHOICES.MD at: [CHOICES.md](./CHOICES.md)  

* INSTALL.md ---> this file includes the instructions needed/required to use our project from:
  * Installing our project
  * Setting it up
  * Manual Deployment Setup
  * Auto Deoployment Setup
* For more Information, please visit INSTALL.MD at: [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md)
* We also have our license stating what you can with our project but you have to keep the original copyright/license with no changes made to it.
  * For more Information, please visit our license at: [LICENSE](./LICENSE)

# Our Project's timeline
* First Week
  * Create our Git Repository with the necessary files needed
  * Improve the content in files(CHOICES.md, INSTALL.md, ReadMe & License)
  * Creating and using OVH account
* Second Week:
  * Connecting deployed website to our repository
  * Provided HTML code for the Website's homepage
  * Improve files such as ReadMe to follow the description of our project
* Third Week: 
  * Finalyzing/fixing any last issues
  * Confirming that everything is functional for release
